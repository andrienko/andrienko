### Who
My name is Ilia (Illya, Illia, Eli, Eliasz... whichever you prefer.)

### What
I am a passionate (no, really), entthusiastic, yet a little grumpy software engineer. I write code since childhood, and prefer web-programming.

I usually work as JavaScript developer. I used Preact and ORP before it was cool. I love meta-programming and the ECMA262.
Most of my work is "single-page applications" of one kind or another.

### Hobbies
I love sci-fi, music and generative art.

### Github
I do not use GitHub to host code. It is a mess. Relax and ask me directly if you are curious for some kind of "samples" of my work.

### Emojis
They say, github profile has to have emojis. There you go:

### Who
My name is Ilia (Illya, Illia, Eli, Eliasz... whichever you prefer.)

### What
I am a passionate (no, really), entthusiastic, yet a little grumpy software engineer. I write code since childhood, and prefer web-programming.

I usually work as JavaScript developer. I used Preact and ORP before it was cool. I love meta-programming and the ECMA262.
Most of my work is "single-page applications" of one kind or another.

### Hobbies
I love sci-fi, music and generative art.

### Github
I do not use GitHub to host code. My github is a mess. I use github for work, tho.

Most of my public repos here are old pieces of stuff I wrote ages ago (and have not cleaned up yet for some reason).
All this code is mine, but might not be the best examples, especially without a context.
That said, if you are looking for samples of my work - github is not the best place to do so.

### Emojis
They say, a github profile has to have emojis. Here are some: 🐸⚔️📈
